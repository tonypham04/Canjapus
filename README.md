# Canjapus
Canjapus (Canada-Japan-United States) is a program written entirely in Lua which converts between Canadian, Japanese and United States currency. The conversion factors used are the ones in place as of Monday, October 12, 2020. The functions for converting between the different currency types are written using a test-driven development approach (i.e. the unit tests are written first and then the corresponding functions are written). The unit test functions are provided from the [**LuaUnit**](https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit) unit-testing framework by Philippe Fremy.
